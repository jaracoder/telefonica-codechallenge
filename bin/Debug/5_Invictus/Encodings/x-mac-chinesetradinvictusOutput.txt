INVICTUS

Out?Å∑ o?Åºf the night th??at covers me?Å∑,
      Black?Å± as the pi??t from pole to?? pol??e,
I thank whate??ver god?Åºs may be
      For my?Å≥ unconquerable sou?Å∫l.

In the fe??ll clutc?ÅΩh of?Åº circumstance??
      I have not win??ced nor cri?ÅΩed aloud.
Under t?Å∫he bludgeonings o?Å∑f chance
      My he?Å∂ad is bloody,?Å∫ but unb?ÅØow?Å∂ed.

Beyond t?Å∫his place?ÅØ of w??rath and tears
      L?Åªooms b?ÅØut the Horr?Åºor of the sh?Å≤ad?Å≥e,
And yet the menace of th?Å∫e ye?ÅØars
      Finds and shall find me unafrai??d.

It m??atters not?? ho?Å≥w strai?Åºt?? the gate,
      Ho?Å∑w charged w?Å±ith punis?Å∂h?ÅØme?Å∫nts t?Å∫h?Å≥e scroll,
I am the master of m?Åºy fat?Åµe,
      I am the captain o?Å≥f m??y soul??.

William Ernest Henley
